# Prophet Challenge
AI Module 19 Challenge

## Challenge Background and Objective:
The objective is to create a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company.  The model will also predict the department that best fits each employee. The two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network. This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/Ebylisa/neural-network-challenge-2).

## Code Summary:
(1)  A repository was created called neural-network-challenge-2 in Git hub. (2) A starter code named attrition.ipynb was downloaded on the local Git repository and GitHub. (3)  The csv file spam-data.csv was read in for the data from the following url:  https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m19/lms/datasets/attrition.csv. (4) The file was then uploaded onto Google Colab to be processed. (5) The data was pre-processed with the train, test, split and the Standard Scaler and One Encoder. (6)  A  branch was created for both the Department and Attrition targets. The model was created, compiled, and trained/fitted and tested for accuracy for both the Department and Attrition.
